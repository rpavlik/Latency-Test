This is mainly a Hardware+Software latency test device (Latency_Hardware
directory), with DIY-able hardware. See that directory for additional
information and instructions.

Can test latency **on any device:** HMD connected to PC, Android-based phone,
etc. All that is needed on the HMD is an application that fades from black to
white depending on the rotation of the head.

Originally developed by Russell Taylor supported by Sensics (now defunct) and
